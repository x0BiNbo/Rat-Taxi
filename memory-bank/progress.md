**What Works:**  
- Project requirements and MVP scope defined.
- Technical and design decisions clarified.
- Minimal playtestable state achieved: city grid, player/taxi movement, fare system, and cheese currency loop are implemented and working.
- Upgrade system and subway fast-travel mechanic are implemented, tested, and working as intended.
- Mini-Map UI is implemented, tested, and working as intended.
- Fare Meter UI is implemented, tested, and working as intended.
- Input controls: S moves the car down, E opens the subway menu at stations.
- Upgrade menu UI now supports tooltips, icons, mouse navigation, and visual feedback (highlight); all related tests pass (TDD).
- SVG asset pipeline is now robust: Cairo DLL issues resolved, all SVG asset tests pass, and fallback logic for missing/corrupt SVGs is implemented and tested (TDD).
- City grid now uses a cross-shaped road layout (horizontal and vertical roads intersecting at the center), spanning the full play area, surrounded by sidewalks for easy asset mapping and accessibility.
- City grid rendering now uses SVG assets for each tile type (road, sidewalk, building), replacing the PNG tileset.
- Cheese is now properly deducted when upgrades are purchased, and this is verified by tests.
- All TDD tests now reflect real game logic and pass.
- Game over state, score tracking, and roguelike upgrade system are now implemented, tested, and working as intended. Game over screen displays score and cheese, allows spending cheese on upgrades, and restarts run with upgrades persisting.
- Asset mapping for sidewalk and building tiles is now robustly test-verified via a new test (test_city_tile_asset_mapping), ensuring all mapped assets render correctly and without error.
- Health UI overlap is fixed: hearts now wrap to new rows for clarity at all health values.
- Roguelike game over now triggers on health depletion, allowing cheese spending and upgrade persistence.
- New SVGs for fare pickup and dropoff are integrated for better visibility.
- Tests added for health UI wrapping, game over on health depletion, and SVG asset loading for new fare icons.
- Game over UI is now clearly separated into info and upgrade panels, with no overlap.
- Upgrade menu navigation and persistence are fully functional and tested during game over.
- The score is now always drawn below the last row of hearts, and this is verified by a test.
- **Standardized all core/corner road and sidewalk SVGs to 40x40 pixels, fixing grid seams and alignment issues.**
- **Tested updated SVGs in-game; grid and tile seams are resolved, and all tiles align perfectly.**
- Player feedback is now visually clear: player icon flashes green for pickups, red for hazards, and blue for fare completion. This is tested and passes TDD.
- Upgrade persistence bug fixed: upgrades purchased in the upgrade menu now persist and affect gameplay after a reset. The fix sets the new Player's upgrade levels from the persistent UpgradeManager on reset. This is now tested and verified in-game.

**What's Left to Build:**  
- Map each tile type (road, sidewalk, building) to the appropriate asset as more assets become available.
- Additional polish and bug fixes.
- **Focus on UI/UX and gameplay improvements:**
  1. Icon contrast (accessibility)
  2. Minimap clarity
  3. Player feedback (visual/audio)
  4. UI layout polish (multi-resolution)
  5. Accessibility enhancements (colorblind, font scaling)
- All improvements will follow TDD: failing tests first, then minimal code to pass, then documentation.
- Icon contrast improvements implemented: all major icons now have outlines and lighter tints, and pass the WCAG 4.5:1 contrast ratio test for accessibility.
- Minimap clarity and accessibility improved: all markers now have outlines and accessible colors, and pass the WCAG 4.5:1 contrast ratio test.

## Rationale
- Improvements are based on best practices for retro/sim games, accessibility, and user feedback.
- TDD ensures all changes are robust and verifiable.
- Memory Bank and documentation are kept current for agentic AI handoff and future development.

## Next Steps
1. Write failing tests for each improvement area.
2. Implement minimal code to pass tests, one area at a time.
3. Run and verify tests after each change.
4. Update documentation and .cursorrules as needed.

**Current Status:**  
- MVP gameplay loop is playtestable. Player can move, pick up, and complete fares, earn cheese, buy upgrades (with cheese deduction), use the subway, see the Mini-Map and Fare Meter, and experience a full game over and upgrade loop with persistent upgrades.
- All fares are reachable and the city layout is easy to expand and configure for future asset integration.
- All tests pass, confirming TDD compliance.

**Known Issues:**  
- Advanced UI features (upgrade menu) are now implemented and tested.
