**What Works:**  
- Project requirements and MVP scope defined.
- Technical and design decisions clarified.
- Minimal playtestable state achieved: city grid, player/taxi movement, fare system, and cheese currency loop are implemented and working.
- Upgrade system and subway fast-travel mechanic are implemented, tested, and working as intended.
- Mini-Map UI is implemented, tested, and working as intended.
- Fare Meter UI is implemented, tested, and working as intended.
- Input controls: S moves the car down, E opens the subway menu at stations.
- Upgrade menu UI now supports tooltips, icons, mouse navigation, and visual feedback (highlight); all related tests pass (TDD).
- SVG asset pipeline is now robust: Cairo DLL issues resolved, all SVG asset tests pass, and fallback logic for missing/corrupt SVGs is implemented and tested (TDD).
- City grid now uses a cross-shaped road layout (horizontal and vertical roads intersecting at the center), spanning the full play area, surrounded by sidewalks for easy asset mapping and accessibility.
- City grid rendering now uses SVG assets for each tile type (road, sidewalk, building), replacing the PNG tileset.
- Cheese is now properly deducted when upgrades are purchased, and this is verified by tests.
- All TDD tests now reflect real game logic and pass.
- Game over state, score tracking, and roguelike upgrade system are now implemented, tested, and working as intended. Game over screen displays score and cheese, allows spending cheese on upgrades, and restarts run with upgrades persisting.

**What's Left to Build:**  
- Map each tile type (road, sidewalk, building) to the appropriate asset as more assets become available.
- Additional polish and bug fixes.

**Current Status:**  
- MVP gameplay loop is playtestable. Player can move, pick up, and complete fares, earn cheese, buy upgrades (with cheese deduction), use the subway, see the Mini-Map and Fare Meter, and experience a full game over and upgrade loop with persistent upgrades.
- All fares are reachable and the city layout is easy to expand and configure for future asset integration.
- All tests pass, confirming TDD compliance.

**Known Issues:**  
- Asset mapping for sidewalk and building tiles is pending until more assets are available.
- Advanced UI features (upgrade menu) are now implemented and tested.
